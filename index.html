			<hr>
			<p>
				I recently started to get involved in web programming. I attend various web development courses and study on my
				own.
				For this reason, I am looking for a company that wants to offer me a place among its developers. In turn, I
				would
				offer my full commitment and be a pleasant and friendly addition to your team.
				Therefore, I am currently looking for a job or internship as a developer.
